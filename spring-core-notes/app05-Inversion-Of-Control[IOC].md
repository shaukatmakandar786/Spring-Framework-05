# Inversion of Control[IOC]:

The IoC container creates an object of the specified class and also injects all the dependency objects through a constructor dependency injection, setter method dependency injection at run time and disposes it at the appropriate time. This is done so that we don't have to create and manage objects manually. 

## there are two ways to achieve dependency injection:

1. Constructor Dependency injecton
2. Setter Method Dependency Injection

## 1. Constructor Dependency injecton

If we inject dependent values to the bean object through Contructor then this type of Dependency injection is called as "Constructor Dependency Injection".

If we want to use constructor dependency injection in spring application,first we have to declared respective parameterized constructor in the corresponding bean class then we have to declared that constructor arguments in spring configuration file by using the following tags.

    <beans>
      <bean...>
        <construct-arg value="---"/>
        <constructor-arg>value</constructor-arg>
      </bean>
    </beans>
